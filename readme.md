<h1> Video Poker Arcade! </h1>

<h2>Current State</h2>
<p>At this point, this is a work in progress, I wish to continue working on this application as my skills progress.</p>
<p>In its currnent version, I was able to achieve the following:</p>
<li> Create a deck of cards from two sets of array's by using a forEach iterator method</li>
<li> Create a randomizer to potentially shuffle that deck of cards </li>
<li> Cache the element references for the deal button, as well as the decrese bet, increase bet and max bet button </li>
<li> functional DOM listeners for the decrease bet, increase bet and max bet button </li>
<li> build a basic vertical layout of the CSS </li>

<h3> version 1.0 </h3>

<h2>Future State</h2>
<p> In the immediate upcoming versions, I plan to update the following </p>
<li> Create basic game states </li>
<li> Create a function that returns a randomized deck to the 'deckarea' </li>
<li> Keep track of betting: when user inputs a bet from 1-5, this amount will decrease from total credits </li>
<li> Create function to hold cards after deal is placed </li>
<li> Create functions for hands. </li>
